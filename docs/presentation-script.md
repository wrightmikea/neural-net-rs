## Introduction (2 min)

### Opening Statement

> "Today I'm going to demonstrate neural-net-rs, an educational neural network framework written in Rust. We'll see how neural networks learn to solve classic logic problems, and I'll show you both command-line and visual interfaces for training and evaluation."

### Quick Overview

> "Neural networks learn by adjusting internal weights through a process called backpropagation. We'll train networks on three logic gates: AND, OR, and XOR. The first two are simple, but XOR is special—it's not linearly separable, meaning you need a hidden layer to solve it."

### What Makes This Interesting

> "What's unique here is that we're using Rust for both the core implementation and the web interface through WebAssembly, demonstrating systems programming and web technologies working together."

## CLI Basics (3 min)

### Step 1: List Available Examples

**What to say:**
> "Let's start by seeing what examples are built-in."

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net list
```

**Expected output:**
```
Available examples:
  and  - Logical AND gate (2 inputs, 1 output)
  or   - Logical OR gate (2 inputs, 1 output)
  xor  - Logical XOR gate (2 inputs, 1 output) [requires hidden layer]
```

**What to say:**
> "We have three classic problems. Let's look at the help to see what options we have."

### Step 2: View Help

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net train --help
```

**What to say while output displays:**
> "Notice we can control the learning rate, number of epochs, hidden layer architecture, and we can save checkpoints for long-running training sessions."

---

## Training Examples (4 min)

### Step 3: Train AND Gate (Simple)

**What to say:**
> "Let's start with the simplest case: the AND gate. It outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1."

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net train --example and --epochs 5000 --output and_model.json
```

**Expected output:**
```
Training AND gate...
Architecture: [2, 2, 1]
Learning rate: 0.5

[========================================] 5000/5000 epochs (100%)

Training complete!
Final loss: 0.0234
Accuracy: 100.00%

Test results:
  [0.0, 0.0] → 0.021 (expected: 0.0) ✓
  [0.0, 1.0] → 0.019 (expected: 0.0) ✓
  [1.0, 0.0] → 0.023 (expected: 0.0) ✓
  [1.0, 1.0] → 0.981 (expected: 1.0) ✓

Model saved to: and_model.json
```

**What to say:**
> "That trained quickly—5,000 epochs in just a few seconds. Notice how the predictions are very close to the expected outputs. The network learned that only 1,1 should output 1."

### Step 4: Evaluate the Model

**What to say:**
> "Let's test a specific input manually."

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net eval --model and_model.json --input "1.0,1.0"
```

**Expected output:**
```
Model: and_model.json
Input: [1.0, 1.0]
Output: [0.981]
```

**What to say:**
> "Close to 1.0, as expected. Now let's try the more interesting XOR problem."

### Step 5: Train XOR Gate (Complex)

**What to say:**
> "XOR is famous in neural network history because it can't be solved with a single layer—you need a hidden layer. This is what led to the development of backpropagation in the 1980s."

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net train --example xor --epochs 10000 --output xor_model.json --verbose
```

**Expected output:**
```
Training XOR gate...
Architecture: [2, 3, 1]
Learning rate: 0.5

Epoch 1000/10000 - Loss: 0.452
Epoch 2000/10000 - Loss: 0.312
Epoch 3000/10000 - Loss: 0.198
Epoch 4000/10000 - Loss: 0.134
Epoch 5000/10000 - Loss: 0.089
Epoch 6000/10000 - Loss: 0.062
Epoch 7000/10000 - Loss: 0.045
Epoch 8000/10000 - Loss: 0.034
Epoch 9000/10000 - Loss: 0.027
Epoch 10000/10000 - Loss: 0.022

Training complete!
Final loss: 0.0219
Accuracy: 100.00%

Test results:
  [0.0, 0.0] → 0.019 (expected: 0.0) ✓
  [0.0, 1.0] → 0.992 (expected: 1.0) ✓
  [1.0, 0.0] → 0.991 (expected: 1.0) ✓
  [1.0, 1.0] → 0.012 (expected: 0.0) ✓

Model saved to: xor_model.json
```

**What to say:**
> "Notice the loss decreased steadily over time. The network learned that XOR outputs 1 when inputs are different, 0 when they're the same. That middle layer with 3 neurons made this possible."

### Step 6: Inspect Model Info

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net info xor_model.json
```

**Expected output:**
```

**What to say:**
> "We can inspect any saved model to see its architecture and training history."

---

## Checkpointing Demo (3 min)

### Step 7: Start Long Training with Checkpoint

**What to say:**
> "For longer training sessions, we can save checkpoints. Let me start training and interrupt it midway."

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net train --example xor --epochs 20000 --checkpoint xor_checkpoint.json
```

**What to say:**
> "I'll let this run for a bit..."

**[Wait 3-5 seconds, then press Ctrl+C]**

**Expected output:**
```
Training XOR gate...
Architecture: [2, 3, 1]
Learning rate: 0.5

[=========>                              ] 2341/20000 epochs (12%)

^C
Interrupt received. Saving checkpoint...
Checkpoint saved to: xor_checkpoint.json
Training interrupted at epoch 2341.
```

**What to say:**
> "The checkpoint was automatically saved when I interrupted. Now I can resume from where I left off."

### Step 8: Resume Training

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net train --resume xor_checkpoint.json --epochs 20000
```

**Expected output:**
```
Resuming from checkpoint: xor_checkpoint.json
Loaded state from epoch 2341

Architecture: [2, 3, 1]
Learning rate: 0.5

[=====>                                  ] 2341/20000 epochs (12%)
Resuming training...

[========================================] 20000/20000 epochs (100%)

Training complete!
Final loss: 0.0198
Accuracy: 100.00%

Checkpoint updated: xor_checkpoint.json
```

**What to say:**
> "Perfect! It continued from epoch 2341 and completed the full 20,000 epochs. This is useful for long-running experiments or when you need to pause and come back later."

## Web UI Demo (3 min)

### Step 9: Start Web Server

**What to say:**
> "Now let's see the visual interface. This is built with WebAssembly, so the neural network actually runs in your browser."

**Command:**
```bash
neural-net serve --port 8080 --open
```

**Expected output:**
```
Starting Neural Network Demonstration Server
============================================

Server running at: http://localhost:8080
Press Ctrl+C to stop

Serving web UI with embedded WASM module
WebSocket connections: 0
```

**[Browser should open automatically to http://localhost:8080]**

### Step 10: Demonstrate Web UI

**What to do (narrate while clicking):**

1. **Select Example**
   > "Let's select XOR from the dropdown."

2. **Adjust Settings (Optional)**
   > "We can adjust the architecture and learning rate here. I'll leave the defaults."

3. **Start Training**
   > "When I click 'Start Training', watch the graph update in real-time."

   **[Click "Start Training"]**

4. **Watch Progress**
   > "See the loss curve decreasing? Each point represents 100 epochs. The table on the right shows current predictions for all test cases."

   > "Notice how the predictions start random but gradually move toward the correct values."

5. **Point Out Features**
   - **Progress bar:** "Shows current epoch and percentage complete"
   - **Loss chart:** "Visual representation of learning progress"
   - **Truth table:** "Live predictions compared to expected outputs"
   - **Color coding:** "Green checkmarks appear when predictions are accurate"

6. **Wait for Completion**
   > "There we go—100% accuracy! The network has learned the XOR function."

### Step 11: Try Different Example

**What to do:**
> "Let's quickly try the OR gate to show how much faster simpler problems train."

**[Select OR from dropdown, click Start Training]**

**What to say:**
> "Watch how quickly this converges—OR is linearly separable, so it learns much faster. Done in just a few thousand epochs!"

### Step 12: Close Server

**[Return to terminal, press Ctrl+C]**

**Expected output:**
```
^C
Shutting down server...
Active connections closed: 1
Server stopped.
```

## Q&A Tips

### Common Questions and Answers

**Q: How does the network actually learn?**

A: "Through backpropagation. After each prediction, we calculate how wrong we were (the loss), then adjust each weight slightly to reduce that error. After thousands of iterations, the weights converge to values that solve the problem."

**Q: Why does XOR need a hidden layer?**

A: "XOR is not linearly separable—you can't draw a single straight line to separate the outputs. The hidden layer creates a non-linear transformation that makes the problem solvable. This was a major breakthrough in the 1980s that revived interest in neural networks."

**Q: How would this scale to real problems like image recognition?**

A: "The principles are identical—you'd just have many more layers and neurons. For images, you'd use convolutional layers to detect features. This framework is intentionally simple for education, but modern libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow use the same fundamental concepts."

**Q: Why Rust instead of Python?**

A: "Great question! Python is dominant in ML for good reasons—ecosystem and ease of use. This project uses Rust to demonstrate: 1) that ML algorithms are just math and can be implemented in any language, 2) Rust's performance and safety benefits, and 3) how Rust can target both native binaries and WebAssembly for diverse deployment."

**Q: Can I add my own examples?**

A: "Absolutely! The code is designed to be educational. You can add new examples by defining the input/output datasets. Check the `examples.rs` module—it's straightforward to extend."

**Q: How accurate is this compared to real neural network libraries?**

A: "The algorithms are mathematically identical to what's in production libraries. The main differences are optimizations—production libraries use GPU acceleration, optimized BLAS routines, and more sophisticated algorithms. But for learning small problems like these, there's no difference."

## Troubleshooting

### If Training Seems Stuck

**Say:** "Sometimes random initialization can be unlucky. Let me restart the training."

**Command:** Re-run the train command. Random initialization means each run is slightly different.

### If Web UI Doesn't Open

**Say:** "Let me open it manually."

**Command:** Open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### If Epochs Take Too Long

**Say:** "For the demo, I'll reduce the epochs."

**Command:** Use `--epochs 5000` instead of 10000 or 20000.

### If Network Doesn't Converge

**Say:** "This is actually interesting—it shows that hyperparameters matter. Let me adjust the learning rate."

**Command:** Try `--learning-rate 0.3` or `--learning-rate 0.7`
